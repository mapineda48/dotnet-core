# Climate

This project is a developer technical test.

## Usage

### docker-compose

Do not complicate configuring an environment to run the application, this demo has a [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/mapineda48/climate) available in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), the only thing you should have installed on your pc is [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), create a directory, in this create a file called `docker-compose.yml` and add the following:

```yml
version: "3.3"
services:
  web:
    image: mapineda48/climate
    environment:
      # Milliseconds, the database service may take a few seconds to be ready, 
      # this value may vary depending on the hardware.
      APP_RUN_DELAY: "10000"
      
      SQLSERVER: "Server=db;User Id=sa;Password=Mypassword12345*;Encrypt=false;Trusted_Connection=False;"
      
      # Register on https://openweathermap.org/ to get it
      WEATHER_KEY_API: "<your api key>"
      
      # Register on https://newsapi.org/ to get it
      NEWS_KEY_API: "<your api key>"
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-CU13-ubuntu-20.04"
    environment:
      ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
      SA_PASSWORD: "Mypassword12345*"
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
```
now open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you created the file and run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
Wait a few minutes while the dependencies are downloaded, the services are configured and when you see that the services are ready go to the browser and go to http://localhost:3000

### docker

If you prefer you can also use the container without docker-compose:

```sh
docker run \
    --name demo \
    -p 3000:80 \
    -e "APP_RUN_DELAY=<time in ms>" \
    -e "SQLSERVER=<string connection>" \
    -e "WEATHER_KEY_API=<your api key>" \
    -e "NEWS_KEY_API=<your api key>" \
    -d \
    mapineda48/climate
```
